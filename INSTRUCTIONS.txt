Project: NGDB_GRAPH_PROJECT (Neo4j + Node/Express backend, Vite React frontend)

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm installed (check with: node -v, npm -v)
- Neo4j 5.x/Enterprise or Aura instance available
- Windows PowerShell (these commands are for PowerShell)

1) Clone or open the project folder
- Path used in examples: C:\Users\lenovo\Downloads\NGDB_GRAPH_DB\NGDB_GRAPH_PROJECT

2) Configure environment variables (backend)
- Create a file at: backend/.env
- Put the following lines (replace placeholders with real values):
  NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
  NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
  NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
  PORT=8000

3) Install dependencies
- Backend
  cd backend
  npm install
  (Keep this terminal open for running.)

- Frontend (open a new terminal in the project root)
  cd frontend
  npm install

4) Run the apps (development)
- Backend (from backend/)
  npm run dev
  Server runs at http://localhost:8000

- Frontend (from frontend/, in a second terminal)
  npm run dev
  App runs at http://localhost:5173
  The frontend proxies /api to http://localhost:8000 per frontend/vite.config.js

5) API base paths
- Public: GET http://localhost:8000/
- Auth routes:     http://localhost:8000/api/auth
- Services routes: http://localhost:8000/api/services
- Doubts routes:   http://localhost:8000/api/doubts

6) Build frontend (optional for production)
- From frontend/
  npm run build
  (Serves static build via your chosen host; backend in this project does not serve the built assets.)

Troubleshooting
- ECONNREFUSED / DB connection errors: Verify backend/.env values match your Neo4j instance and that the DB is running.
- CORS errors: The backend allows origin http://localhost:5173 by default (see backend/src/server.js). Adjust if you use a different port or host.
- Port in use: Change PORT in backend/.env and update frontend/vite.config.js proxy target accordingly.
